# Week 2 notes
## Arrays

### Compiler
- make was function made to make compiling code easier; automates
- actual compiler == clang for c codes last week
- output was a.out
- command line arguments to change name when running clang
   - clang -o <output name>
- have to link the libraries called in the beginning of the code or there will be an error when compiling <br>

Steps of compiling:
1. preprocessing
   - adds functions from libraries at beginning of code
2. compiling
   - source code to assembly language, which contains computer instructions
3. assembling
4. linking


### Arrays
- arrays in C index at 0
